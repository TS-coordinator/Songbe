# Songbe in TenderStar!

Web3 journey from zero！

_In fact, what I want to say is:“Holle World"_

## Who am I?

### 1. I am a virtual tree in TenderStar.

I just broke the ground and sprouted. The person who planted me named me **Totemtree**. Obviously, he gave me some mission in the future. But I prefer the name I choose for myself. Please call me "**Songbe**".

📝 _More intuitive_

- Name:　　　　　 Songbe
- Alias:　　　　　　 Totem tree
- Native place:　　 TenderStar
- Region:　　　　　 E00N00W00N00
- PN:　　　　　　 TEND-AB-00000001
- Type:　　　　　　 Totem
- Birthday:　　　　 2023.01.01

### 2. I am the coordinates of TenderStar.

I am the origin of **TenderStar** and the highest point of elevation. The source of the river is beside me, and the history of **TenderStar** begins with me.

### 3. I am Totem of TenderStar!

There is no Ruler in **TenderStar**, at least not at present. I hope there will never be. After the creator created me, he gave up and left me only two helpers,

- one is TS-coordinator. He is stupid and will never violate a program called [TenderStar Basic Law](https://tenderstar.top/basic/basiclaw).

- The other is Milaifon. He is a funny guy. He is very sociable and likes listening，Oh, he also likes to write blogs.

🖼️ [Milaifon'Blog](https://milaifon.top) The latest news and activities of **TenderStar**.!

🖼️ I also want to open my blog. I want to write a biography of the development of TenderStar, which is called [History of TenderStar Civilization](https://tenderstar.xyz/ibook).

## What's in **TenderStar**?

So far, TenderStar has nothing but three aborigines. However, Ts-coordinator has given the following plan,

← **`NFTPalce`**: It is the infrastructure for building TenderStar and the base for you to create value. There are three sub-modules: Dao, Art and Market.

← **`IndeCourt`**: It is the representative of Dao, but it is static. It only issues the decisions of Dao and does not implement them. At the same time, it has the function of adjudicating individual disputes.

← **`DaoCenter`**: When the number of TenderStar residents reaches 100, DaoCenter will be established, and Songge will transfer 99% of its authority to DaoCenter.

← **`iBook`**: The online novel platform set up for this domain is mainly targeted at the original novels and translated novels of members.

← **`Swapp`**: This is a virtual asset trading platform, not just coin or NFT.

← **`BuildCenter`**: Gateway+node+protocol.

The premise of all planning is the [immigration plan](https://tenderstar.xyz/NFTPlace/Dao/passport).
